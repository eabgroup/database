Public database for the Vanderbilt Arboretum
========

The full arboretum tree database is part of the Vanderbilt campus GIS.  The data provided here is a subset of "trees of interest" that have been measured and whose position and taxonimic identity have been field verified.

The measured-trees.xlsx file is the primary file and the csv version is provided so that it can be viewed directly through the GitHub Web interface.  

dbh (diameter at breast height) measurements were made directly using a metric dbh tape.  Height measurements are crude estimates as are the average crown spread measurements.  The crown spread was determined by measuring the maximum width and the width perpendicular to the maximum.  The two widths were then averaged.  

Points are calculated by the sum of the circumference in inches, the height in feet, and 1/4 of the crown spread in feet in accordance with the American Forests Big Tree program (http://www.americanforests.org/our-programs/bigtree/).

If trees have been assigned a URI guid, it resolves to a web page about the tree showing a map of its location and information about its taxonmic determination.  The page also has links to images of parts of the tree.
